# CPQ 301 Capstone Project
This project showcases a comprehensive implementation of Salesforce CPQ, delivering an end-to-end solution for configuring, pricing, and quoting a new product line. It effectively addresses the complex requirements of product setup, bundling, pricing strategy, and asset generation for a company's innovative offerings.

## Problem Statement
